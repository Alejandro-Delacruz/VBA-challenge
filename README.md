# VBA-challenge 

I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data from 2018-2012. And the VBA code summarized the percentage, yearly change and total stock volume for each ticker, it also listed the greatest increase, greatest decrease and greatest total volume. 

This repository has the VBA code file as well as the raw data. It also includes screenshots of analyzed results for example in Year 2018 the Greatest percentage increase is 141.42% made by THB. The Greatest decrease is 90.02% by RKS. The Greatest Yearly total volume is 1.69e12.
There is one requirement needed to run the attached VBA code which is, one has to sort the raw data by: 1. <Ticker> and 2. <Date>.

The benefit of using VBA is that instead of manually updating the result each time new data comes in one can simply refresh the Micro function which significantly improves the working efficiency.
